**TODO**

- Check if Carpet mod is installed and use player faker mod from within Carpet
- Rewrite player entity classes to only provide the functions required for this mod (Currently Carpet Rip) 
- Configuration options
     - Disable worlds 
     - Control how far players can travel away from clone 
     - Disable clone / damage
